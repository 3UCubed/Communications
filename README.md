# Communications: GPredict

- Link to GPredict 2.2.1: https://github.com/csete/gpredict/releases/tag/v2.2.1

We want to use GPredict as it is an open source tracking software that will help us track our satellite and make sure to keep contact while in our field of view. Since we updated the GS computer, we can now use a newer version of GPredict (we were previously using 1.3.x, not sure of the exact version).

#From the GPredict README:
Gpredict is a real time satellite tracking and orbit prediction program
for the Linux desktop. It uses the SGP4/SDP4 propagation algorithms together
with NORAD two-line element sets (TLE).

Some core features of Gpredict include:

- Tracking of a large number of satellites only limited by the physical
  memory and processing power of the computer
- Display the tracking data in lists, maps, polar plots and any combination
  of these
- Have many modules open at the same either in a notebook or in their own
  windows. The modules can also run in full-screen mode
- You can use many ground stations
- Predict upcoming passes
- Gpredict can run in real-time, simulated real-time (fast forward and
  backward), and manual time control
- Detailed information both the real time and non-real time modes
- Doppler tuning of radios via Hamlib rigctld
- Antenna rotator control via Hamlib rotctld
